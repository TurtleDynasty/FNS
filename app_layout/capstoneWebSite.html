 <h3>Data Visualization for Enterprise Storage</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> 
Our project was really to create a way for system administrators to look at all of
the information being created by IBM's Spectrum Protect product, and interpret that
information in a meaningful way. Their interpretation of this information would
inherently lead to managing their use of Spectrum Protect in a cost effective and
efficient manner.
</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;"> 
The idea to help system administrators understand how to better manage the data
that is being stored on Spectrum Protect servers stemmed from the idea of data visualization
or to be more precise the lack of it. In IBM's case they did not have a sure method to visually
show a system administrator the status of their company/businesses’ information on
these servers. While the system administrator were provided this information, it was provided in 
a manner that even veteran users of the Spectrum Protect product had difficulty deciphering
what was or was not important for their management needs. In other words,
is there an accessible and easy to use tool that the system administrators can 
use to make informed decisions regarding the storage of their information
on Spectrum Protect servers? That is where team FNS came in.
</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;"> 
Our task was to solve this problem and to create a tool for the system administrators
who use Spectrum Protect. In order to solve this problem we first asked ourselves 
"What kind of information, that IBM provides, is most useful in properly
managing data on a Spectrum Protect server?" With this in mind we were able to take
all of the relevant information given by IBM and create meaningful and intuitive visuals
for that information. These visuals would in turn be the tools that a system administrator would
use to gain a better grasp on the current status of the information that they store
on Spectrum Protect servers. Each of the different visuals provide an immediate grasp 
of the status of different aspects how their data is handled and stored on Spectrum Protect
servers which leads to being able to better manage that same data.
</p><p style="text-indent: 2em;"> 
In the end we were able to create a variety of visuals for system administrators.
This in turn shows IBM that creating visual representations for important data
can have a real impact on how a system administrator goes about managing the data
on IBM's Spectrum Protect servers. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor, in the form of a <a href="Resources/Data_Visualization_Project_Description.pdf" download>Capstone project proposal</a>.</p>

 <h3>Requirements</h3>
 <p>To ensure success of the project, we identified a number of functional, 
    performance, and environmental requirements. This development path was used to both guide 
    and measure implementation. In terms of functional requirements we identified all parts of the application
    that were crucial to achieving the end of goal of this project. The performance based requirements
    were used to gain a grasp on how efficient the application would be, specifically how quick the system is
    in generating visualizations based on large data sets. Finally the environmental  requirements
    allowed us to hone in on all outside dependancies that we do not have control over; ranging from external libraries
    being used to if a user has disabled JavaScript. 
    

 </p>
 <p>The core list of requirements for our application are as follows:</p>
  <ul> 
	<li>Data Filtration:</li>
	<ul><li>A visualization must be filterable, allowing the user to include or exclude specific objects from the visualization.</li></ul>
        <li>Graph Selection:</dt>
	<ul><li>The application should have multiple clear, responsive, interactive visualizations.</li></ul>
	<li>Notifications/Messages:</dt>
	<ul><li>The application should communicate critical notifications and suggested actions through a message center.</li></ul>
	<li>Login Page:</dt>
	<ul><li>The application should have a simple security system to prevent unauthorized access.</li></ul>
	<li>Familiar User Interface:</dt>
	<ul><li>The application should provide a simple, interactive, and easy to navigate user-interface that feels familiar to the user.</li></ul>
	<li>Quick Load Times:</dt>
	<ul><li>The application should fetch and visualize data from the database quickly and efficiently.</li></ul>
   </ul>

  <img src="Resources/github.jpg" alt="git hub" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> GitHub is a web based version control repository. This was chosen because team FNS was familiar with this
      specific repository. Every member of team FNS is knowledgeable in version control and has consistently used GitHub throughout 
      the development of this application.
</p>
  </div>

   <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2>Atom Text Editor</h2>
  <img src="Resources/AtomLogo.png" alt="atom" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> Atom is an open source text editor that is available all on platforms. Atom was specifically chosen as our primary IDE because of
      the fact that it is easy to use and it supports a majority of all the current and popular languages used in the Computer Science field.
  </p>
  </div> 

  <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2>MySQL</h2>
  <img src="Resources/mysql.jpg" alt="mysql" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> MySQL is an open source database that Web sites and Enterprise level companies alike. We chose MySQL because we are both familiar with using
      MySQL and we were given no restriction on which database technology to use with all test data given to us.
      The point of using MySQL was to store all of the test data that our sponsors gave to us to use. Specifically this data was analyzed in order
      to find information that was relevant to a system administrator making informed decisions when managing their data on the Spectrum Protect servers,
      and to visualize that information. After we found the proper visuals for said data we used queries to communicate with the database and feed the 
      data returned by the database to the visuals.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2 >HTML & Bootstrap</h2>
  <img src="Resources/bootstrap.jpg" alt="php" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> HTML was used as the underlying frame used to create this web application. This conforms to the standards of web applications that all use HTML.
      In order to give the application a unique yet familiar look we used Bootstrap which is a great framework for fast front-end development. In particular
      Bootstrap allowed us to provide the system administrator with a familiar user interface which is akin to the current version (as of 2017) of the Spectrum Protect product.

   </p>

  <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2 >Backbone</h2>
  <img src="Resources/backboneLogo.png" alt="php" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> Backbone is a JavaScript library that provides a framework for key-value binding and custom events. This is critical for our application as
      dashboard of this application removes and modularizes all the pieces of this application to increase its flexibility.
   </p>
  </div> 

  <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2 >PHP</h2>
  <img src="Resources/php.jpg" alt="php" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> PHP was used for a few separate reasons. Apart from being familiar with PHP,
      PHP allowed us to create scripts that would run in the background of our application in different cases.
      For example, in order to actually retrieve the data needed for a visual, a script runs in the background
      that communicates with the MySQL database and returns that data to the visualization. We also used this script to
      take care of the login page; this includes a validation page that checks against the database to make sure that 
      no unwanted access occurs. Lastly we used a PHP script to quickly load the test data into the MySQL database.
   </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2 >JavaScript</h2>
  <img src="Resources/js.jpg" alt="javascript" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> JavaScript was used specifically to improve upon the initial functionality of our original application prototype.
      JavaScript allowed team FNS to introduce and expand the ways that a system administrator navigates the application.
      </p>
  </div>
 
  <div class="tech" style="clear:left"><h2 >D3.js</h2>
  <img src="Resources/d3js.png" alt="d3" style="width:100px;height:125px;float:left;margin-right:40px">
  <p> D3 is a JavaScript library that is specifically used to visualize data. This was our primary choice because it was recommended to us by our sponsors.
      All of the visuals used by team FNS on this project stemmed from an initial base visual; the initial visuals can be found at <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js.org</a>
      where there is a lot of various example of different visualizations for different kinds of data ranging from basic bar graphs to intricate heat maps.
      Team FNS then proceeded to modify and expand upon all of the different visuals that were used in order to add different features to the visual for both
      the requirements of this project as well as to increase the usability of the visualizations. This included adding a way to filter out data from the visual,
      adding legends to the visual, increasing all sizes for increased readability, and modifying these visuals so that they can handle large amounts of data at a time.
      Finally all of the D3 visuals are taken and placed in the dashboard where it uses a php script to fill in the visual with relevant data.</p>

  <h2>Current Status</h2>
  <p>As shown in the figure above team FNS is currently approaching finishing up the final requirements of the Data Visualization project. We have gone through all of the information produced from the Spectrum Protect servers and found all
     relevant and imperative information that is necessary to analyze when managing your data on the Spectrum Protect server.
     Every single piece of information has a predetermined visual that best represents that data. The filtering system is the final stages of development, but currently works properly on a few of the different data sets.
     Lastly all of the data that is used for the visualizations is stored in a secure location which provides more than enough space for additional data.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Future Completions</h2>
  <p>Team FNS is currently in the process of updating all the visuals so that they are clean and easily readable. As mentioned in the previous section we are in the just about done with the
     filtering system, which will be done within the next week. The messaging system will also be completed as we within the next couple of weeks. Finally the email system will also be done within the
     next couple of weeks.

  <p>Link to a demo? Some teams that were producing web-apps or similar web-based products have tried including a link to a running demo in their website. This is super-cool...but very fragile. The demo site usually gets abandoned or goes off line, and then you have a dead link. Much much (!!) better is to include a "screen shot walkthrough" of your final product that shows key pages along with maybe some quick explanation of what you're seeing in the image. </p>
